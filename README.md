# conviva-js-appanalytics
Conviva Use Application Analytics to autocollect events and track application specific events and state changes.

# Installation

```
npm install @convivainc/conviva-js-appanalytics
```

```
yarn add @convivainc/conviva-js-appanalytics
```
# Usage
## Import to you project
Import the required packages into your project:
```js
import { convivaAppTracker, trackPageView, trackCustomEvent, setUserId, setClientId, getClientId } from '@convivainc/conviva-js-appanalytics';
```

## Initialization
Initialize the tracker as early as possible during the DOM load sequence.

Init the SDK with appId, customerKey and optional parameters. 
- appId: set this to your understandable application name, reflecting the platform and brand of your app. As an example: "WEB App", "LGTV Web App".
- convivaCustomerKey: the unique string identifier for your Conviva account. Provided by Conviva / can be obtained in the Conviva Pulse dashboard. 
- appVersion: set app version in string format.

```js
convivaAppTracker({
  appId: 'YOUR_APP_NAME_AS_STRING',
  convivaCustomerKey: 'CONVIVA_ACCOUNT_CUSTOMER_KEY',
  appVersion: "1.1.0"
});

```
#### Note:- Eco Sensor utilises localstorage to cache some data.
### Client ID Synchronization
- Mobile App to WebView Synchronization
- Cross-Subdomain Client ID Synchronization

When integrating multiple Conviva ECO Sensor instances across different environments (e.g., subdomains of a single customer, mobile apps opening webviews), clientId may not be shared automatically. To maintain consistency, the sensor provides getClientId and setClientId APIs to manually synchronize clientId between instances.
#### getClientId()
Retrieves the current clientId from an already initialized sensor instance.
```js
// Always call getClientId() after convivaAppTracker()
convivaAppTracker({
  appId: 'YOUR_APP_NAME_AS_STRING',
  convivaCustomerKey: 'CONVIVA_ACCOUNT_CUSTOMER_KEY',
  appVersion: "1.1.0"
});
clientId = getClientId();
```

#### setClientId(clientId)
Sets a specific clientId before initializing the SDK.

```js
// Always call setClientId() before convivaAppTracker()
setClientId(clientId);
convivaAppTracker({
  appId: 'YOUR_APP_NAME_AS_STRING',
  convivaCustomerKey: 'CONVIVA_ACCOUNT_CUSTOMER_KEY',
  appVersion: "1.1.0"
});
```
## Set the user id (viewer id)
```js
setUserId('replace_me_by_the_userId');
```

## Report Page View for tracking in-app page navigations.
By default document.title is set as page title but you can also pass custom page title details in trackPageView.
```js
trackPageView(); // default page title is document.title
trackPageView({"title": "Custom Page Title"});
```

## Custom event tracking to track your application specific events and state changes
Use trackCustomEvent() API to track all kinds of events. This API provides 2 fields to describe the tracked events.

name - Name of the custom event.

data - Any type of data in json format.

The following example shows the data in JSON format.

```js
let custom_data = {
                    "identifier1": "test",
                    "identifier2": 1,
                    "identifier3":true
                  };

trackCustomEvent({
  name: "custom_event_name",
  data: custom_data
});
```

#### Conviva Video Events to App Insight
We need minimum of the Video Sensor Core SDK Version of 4.5.13 to be in a stage to delegate the events:

[v4.5.13](https://github.com/Conviva/conviva-js-coresdk/releases/tag/v4.5.13)

4.5.13 (27/DEC/2022)
    - Supports broadcasting video events to Conviva Eco SDKs to consume. For non App Insights users, there is no impact.
    - We only send following fields from video events into Eco events (name, sid, iid, clid, st, cen, ced, an).

[v4.7.11](https://github.com/Conviva/conviva-js-coresdk/releases/tag/v4.7.11)

4.7.11 (30/SEP/2024)
    - Added required attributes in Video events broadcasted to Conviva ECO Sensor SDKs to consume. For non ECO users, there is no impact.
    - We send following fields from video events into Eco events (name, sid, iid, clid, st, cen, ced, an, pn, cl, lv, tags, vid, url, sst, sid, fw, fwv, mv, mn, old, new).


## Setting / Unsetting Custom tags to report your application specific data.
Use setCustomTags() API to set all kinds of tags (key value pairs). This API provides 1 argument that accepts data in JSON Format to describe the tags.

The following example shows the implementation of setting custom tags.
In this example we have 3 different tags tagKey1, tagKey2, tagKey3 with 3 different values.

```js
let customTagsToSet = {"tagKey1": "tagValue1","tagKey2": 1,"tagKey3":true};
setCustomTags(customTagsToSet);

```

Use unsetCustomTags() API to unset or remove that were already set. This API provides 1 argument to describe an array of tag keys to unset.

The following example shows the implementation of unset or remove custom tags.
```js
let customTagsToUnset = ['tagKey2', 'tagKey3'];
unsetCustomTags(customTagsToUnset);

```
## AutoCollection of Network Request made using XMLHttpRequest and fetch api
This feature supports to track the Network Requests triggered with in application using XMLHttpRequest and fetch api
*Note: This collection is disabled by default, reach out to Conviva Team enabling the tracking.* <br>

<br> *Here are some of the granular details/limitations of the feature:*
* *Response and Request Body atributes are collected only when the:*
    * *size is < 10kb and the content-length is available* 
    * *response body is type json and content-type is "json", "text/plain", "text/javascript" or "application/javascript"*
* *Response and Request Headers are collected only when the:*
    * *server is provisioned with "Access-Control-Expose-Headers:*"* 



## AutoCollection of Meta tags from HEAD section of HTML page

    <summary><b>Auto-collected Events</b></summary>


##### Conviva provides a rich set of application performance metrics with the help of autocollected app events, such as _button_click_, and _network_request_.

Event | Occurrence | Notes |
------|------------|-------|
network_request | after receiving the network request response | only supports xmlHttpRequest/fetch|
page_ping | Max X and Y scroll positions difference comparing to the last event|
application_error | when an error occurrs in the application|
button_click | on the button click callback| only if element is type button or button tag \n preventDefault and stopPropagation prevents to auto collect these events|
link_click | on the link click callback|only if element is anchor tag \n preventDefault and stopPropagation prevents to auto collect these events|
application_background | when visibility state change to `hidden`|
application_foreground | when visibility state change to `visible`|
Largest Contentful Paint| timing information about the largest image or text paint before user input on a web page| Context|
First App Launch| First time launch in the browser|Custom Tag Context|
page_loaded | On "load" event listener | Used to compute Page Loads, Avg Document Load Time, Avg DNS Lookup Time, Avg Document Response Time metrics.

To learn about the default metrics for analyzing the native and web applications performance, such as App Crashes, Avg Screen Load Time, and Page Loads, refer to the [ECO Metrics](https://pulse.conviva.com/learning-center/content/eco/eco_metrics.html) page in the Learning Center.
